Thank you for your detailed response. However, I must firmly reiterate and clarify my position regarding the issues raised, supported by applicable labor laws and workplace standards.
1. Unjustified Salary Deductions and Restrictions on Prayer
I have raised multiple times with HR and the legal department that salary deductions for praying, restroom breaks, and lunch are completely unjustified. Despite my repeated complaints, no corrective action was taken.
Moreover, it was repeatedly insisted to us that praying during work hours is not allowed and that we should only pray after finishing work. This directive is unreasonable, disrespectful, and contradicts UAE labor laws and cultural norms that protect religious freedom and employee well-being. No law supports deducting salary for lawful religious practices or basic health needs.
Such treatment is unacceptable, unlawful, and contributes to a hostile and demoralizing work environment.
2. Excessive and Unprofessional Micromanagement by HR
While reasonable supervision is part of any workplace, the actions taken by HR far exceed professional standards. Entering our private chats and monitoring our computers without consent is a serious violation of privacy and is entirely unprofessional. Furthermore, addressing employees with disrespectful language—such as calling them “not good” or “children”—is unacceptable and creates a toxic work environment. Such behavior undermines morale, trust, and dignity.
The claim that all employees accept this treatment is inaccurate. I maintain close communication with many colleagues, and several have already submitted formal complaints regarding these issues. This indicates a broader concern about the HR practices that cannot be dismissed as isolated or individual perceptions.
3. Regarding Human Resources and Workplace Conduct
The statement that telling an employee “you are free to stay or leave” is merely a neutral reflection of company policy ignores the importance of respectful communication and constructive conflict resolution in a professional workplace. Such a response dismisses legitimate concerns and undermines employee morale, which is neither transparent nor fair.
While I acknowledge the need for maintaining productivity, the way HR addressed these matters was unprofessional and unfairly personal. Unlike other colleagues, I have not received complaints about my movement or conversations during working hours. The issues raised were directed solely at me, which indicates that this was not about general policy enforcement but personal targeting.
From the very first time I entered HR’s office, I was repeatedly spoken to in a condescending manner—being treated like a child, told I don’t understand, and even being kicked out of the office. This behavior is unacceptable, unprofessional, and has created a hostile work environment exclusively directed toward me.
Moreover, I have raised multiple times that the language used by HR was disrespectful and unacceptable, yet no corrective action was taken.
HR’s responsibility is to foster a professional and supportive environment by balancing rule enforcement with empathy and open communication. Unfortunately, in this case, the conduct demonstrated by HR has been the opposite.
4. Project Management and Structure
While I respect management’s strategic decisions, the lack of a formal project manager and proper documentation has impacted workflow clarity and efficiency. These are legitimate operational concerns, raised in good faith with the intent of improving team performance and project delivery—not baseless complaints.
5. Regarding Expectations from the Company
While I acknowledge the company’s obligations regarding salary, working hours, and adherence to policies, it is incorrect and unfair to dismiss employee well-being, workplace dignity, and respect as mere “individual comforts” or “personal requests.” These factors are fundamental components of a healthy, productive, and legally compliant work environment.
UAE labor laws and international workplace standards emphasize the employer’s responsibility to provide a safe, respectful, and supportive environment that promotes employee health, religious rights, and psychological well-being. These are not optional extras but essential obligations.
The issues I raised reflect genuine concerns about workplace conditions and treatment that have adversely affected my ability to perform my duties effectively and with dignity. They are not fabrications or excuses, but documented experiences shared in good faith.
While my decision to resign is my right, it is regrettable that valid concerns were dismissed rather than addressed constructively. I urge the company to consider these matters seriously to improve the work environment for current and future employees.
I trust the company will honor my resignation respectfully and ensure full compliance with all applicable labor laws regarding final settlements.
Thank you for your attention.
Kind regards,
Rahma
